# Introduction
Just a cloud enthousiast using BeyondTrust's Privileged Remote Access API to automate :-)

This repository is where I'll eventually try to place white labeled powershell scripts you can use to authenticate, automate configuration and hopefully fully understand BeyondTrust's Privileged Remote Access system.

I myself use a combination of Azure Automation, Powershell scripts, DevOps repositories and finally BeyondTrust's PRA to fully automate the enrollment of remote systems into our privileged access solution.
